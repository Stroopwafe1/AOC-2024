# Advent of Code 2024

This year I honestly wasn't as excited for it as the other years. And I do want to use my own programming language [Forest](https://github.com/Stroopwafe1/Forest) as I did last year
However, as I am in the process of making it self-hosted, and haven't implemented enough yet for it to be nice to work with... I can't really use it for AOC.

I also decided to take AOC a bit less serious. Previous years it could take up a whole day for me if I was struggling with a problem, and I couldn't let it go. This time I will try to take it a lot more chill and just do them whenever it suits me, this might mean I might skip a day here and there. But that is acceptable for me right now.
